# Kanban Plus

**A feature-enhanced fork of the popular Kanban plugin for Obsidian**

Kanban Plus is built on the solid foundation of [mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) and stays synchronized with upstream while adding powerful new capabilities for advanced project management and interconnected workflows.

## 🔄 About This Fork

Kanban Plus maintains **100% compatibility** with the original Kanban plugin while extending it with:

- **Cross-file card movement** between associated Kanban boards
- **Advanced calendar integration** with hashtag-based visual feedback
- **Enhanced workflow features** for complex project management
- **Zero breaking changes** - all your existing boards continue to work perfectly

This plugin is designed to **stay in sync** with the original Kanban plugin, incorporating upstream improvements while providing additional functionality for power users.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Development**

Kanban Plus is developed and maintained using AI-assisted tools to ensure:

- Rapid feature development and bug fixes
- Comprehensive testing across different scenarios
- Up-to-date documentation and compatibility
- Quick adaptation to Obsidian API changes

### 📝 **Why Fork Kanban (Not Bases)?**

While the Obsidian community has various task management solutions—including Bases, which shows great potential for future Kanban support but doesn't currently offer Kanban boards or user-ordered lists—Kanban Plus specifically builds on the original Kanban plugin for one crucial reason: **simple bulleted list representation**.

The goal is to provide a complete workflow solution that scales from quick capture to advanced project management and scheduling, all while maintaining a **plain text foundation**. This approach enables:

- **Future-proof storage** - your boards remain readable without the plugin
- **Version control friendly** - clean diffs and merge conflicts
- **Universal compatibility** - works across any markdown-compatible system
- **Simplicity at scale** - from single lists to complex multi-board workflows

This philosophy powers the enhanced features: cross-file movement and calendar integration create a unified system for task management that never strays from markdown's simplicity.
